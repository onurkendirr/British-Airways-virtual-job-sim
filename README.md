# British Airways Virtual Job Simulation

- Completed a simulation focussing on how data science is a critical component of British Airways success
- Scraped and analysed customer review data to uncover findings
- Built a predictive model to understand factors that influence buying behaviour

## Scrape data from the web

This simulation focused on exploring the critical role of data science in British Airways' success. The first step I took was to collect customer reviews about British Airways from a website called Skytrax. I focused on gathering as much data as possible, as more data would improve the accuracy of my analysis.

## Analyse data & Present insights

Once the data collection was complete, I noticed that the data was quite messy and in raw text form. Therefore, I needed to clean the data. During the cleaning process, I removed unnecessary words, symbols, and stop words to prepare the data for analysis.

After cleaning the data, I decided to perform some analyses. I used techniques such as topic modeling, sentiment analysis, and word clouds to explore the content of the reviews and uncover key insights from them.

## Explore and prepare the dataset

To further understand the data, I explored the dataset in the "Getting Started" Jupyter Notebook, reviewing the different columns and basic statistics. During this step, I also worked on creating new features that could improve the predictive power of the model.

## Train a machine learning model

Finally, I trained a machine learning model on the data. The objective of the model was to predict whether a customer would make a booking or not. I used a RandomForest algorithm because it’s particularly useful for understanding how each variable contributes to the model’s predictive power.
